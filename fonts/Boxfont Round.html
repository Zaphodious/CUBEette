<h3 class="medium">THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM (Edgar Allan Poe)</h3>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I WAS sick -- sick unto death with that long agony; and when 
they at length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses 
were leaving me. The sentence -- the dread sentence of death -- was the last of 
distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound of the 
inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum. It conveyed 
to my soul the idea of revolution -- perhaps from its association in fancy with 
the burr of a mill wheel. This only for a brief period; for presently I heard no 
more. Yet, for a while, I saw; but with how terrible an exaggeration! I saw the 
lips of the black-robed judges. They appeared to me white -- whiter than the 
sheet upon which I trace these words -- and thin even to grotesqueness; thin 
with the intensity of their expression of firmness -- of immoveable resolution 
-- of stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees of what to me was 
Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them writhe with a deadly 
locution. I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered because 
no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious horror, the soft 
and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls 
of the apartment. And then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the 
table. At first they wore the aspect of charity, and seemed white and slender 
angels who would save me; but then, all at once, there came a most deadly nausea 
over my spirit, and I felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched 
the wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel forms became meaningless 
spectres, with heads of flame, and I saw that from them there would be no help. 
And then there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought of 
what sweet rest there must be in the grave. The thought came gently and 
stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation; but just as 
my spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it, the figures of the 
judges vanished, as if magically, from before me; the tall candles sank into 
nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of darkness 
supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of 
the soul into Hades. Then silence, and stillness, night were the universe.</p>
